        showDesc1: 'A 2-D Platformer set in a Solarpunk future, where resources are scarce after the rebuilding of a war-torn continent. Technology still thrives, and solar-powered, air-propelled hoverboards signify a promise of a greener distribution network, although larger vehicles have yet to be realized. The game follows Cel, a smuggler who races across borders to ensure her found community can survive. However, she cannot outpace her past.',
        showDesc2: '"Project: HOVERBOARD" was built in Unity 5 and programmed in C#. This project is a hobby endeavor, and is a fantastic creative outlet as well as sandbox for programming practice. My focus in this project was to create a game which utilized Pixel Perfect Camera, while creatively manipulating the physics engine to get the feeling of acceleration and control similar to racing games such as Kirby Air Ride.'
