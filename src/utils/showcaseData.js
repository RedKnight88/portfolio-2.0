        showDesc1: 'A 2-D roguelike with comic design and cosmic characters. Ea-nāṣir has been up to his old tricks, selling low grade copper to shoppers at the Babylon Bazaar! Now his irate customers are on a rampage, threatening to destroy the whole mall! The divine shopkeepers of Babylon Bazaar have called on you, Gilgamesh, to stop the angry mob.',
        showDesc2: 'Divine Elevator was a project done for the Philly Game Mechanics August 2024 Game Jam, working with 4 other folks. This project was presented in the Game Developer Showcase at the PHL Gaming Conference in Philadelphia in September 2024. This game was built using Godot 4 and programmed in C#. For this jam, I focused on creating an item system, enemies with randomized sprites, and player combat. A lot of custom classes, custom resources, and a component model to creating game objects (all of which did not have many tutorials for C#) became my challenges which I overcame.'

        showDesc1: 'A 2-D Platformer set in a Solarpunk future, where resources are scarce after the rebuilding of a war-torn continent. Technology still thrives, and solar-powered, air-propelled hoverboards signify a promise of a greener distribution network, although larger vehicles have yet to be realized. The game follows Cel, a smuggler who races across borders to ensure her found community can survive. However, she cannot outpace her past.',
        showDesc2: '"Project: HOVERBOARD" was built in Unity 5 and programmed in C#. This project is a hobby endeavor, and is a fantastic creative outlet as well as sandbox for programming practice. My focus in this project was to create a game which utilized Pixel Perfect Camera, while creatively manipulating the physics engine to get the feeling of acceleration and control similar to racing games such as Kirby Air Ride.'

        showDesc1: 'A top-down, 2-D arcade game. A spark has broken away from the crowded electric hallways of copper wire, and is now attempting to find a way to escape. This spark must find powerups along the way to assist in their adventure, and find a way through the levels before time runs out!',
        showDesc2: 'This was my first project diving into the Godot engine. Coding with C# and not gdscript was a bit challenging at first, but I was able to get all the basics of a game to function. The idea around this was to create a game similar to browser-based games I loved as a kid, like "Worlds Hardest Game". I do plan on revisiting this to spruce it up and make a full experience in the near future.'

        showDesc1: 'A proof of concept for a 3-D platformer where the tiles beneath the player can be controlled to change colors. Through this they could boost their jump height, their speed, or their ability to knock around enemies. There are also collectibles and a time constraint for each level.',
        showDesc2: 'This was my first project, which I helped design and program with my best friend. This was built with Unity and programmed in C#, and contained all the classic struggles of attempting to actually make a functioning game. Character movement, camera controls and constraints, and swapping scenes... all the basics were part of the requirements for the project.'
