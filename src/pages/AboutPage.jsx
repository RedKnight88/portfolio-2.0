            <img/>
            <p>My name is Ryan Sauter, and I am an aspiring Software Developer. Since my time at the prestigious Purdue University, I have engaged with different Computer Science classes and the basics of coding. Starting with C and MATLAB, I have been creating data-oriented algorithms for years. Recently, I decided to take a serious step towards Web Development and Software Programming as a career by enrolling in a bootcamp through edX and the University of Pennsylvania with a focus on the MERN full-stack of technologies.</p>
            <p>I am 24 years old. I am currently located in Philadelphia and open for work. I have a passion for esports, since 2017 I have been running tournaments. My spare time is spent running, reading, and tending to my tiny windowsill garden.</p>
