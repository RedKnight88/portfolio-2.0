  [![License: Unlicense](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Unlicense-blue.svg)](http://unlicense.org/)

## Description
A portfolio is essential for any programmer. It's especially essential when it teaches that programmer the most sought-after framework on the web! ReactJS was a beast to conquer, and there's still plenty more to learn, but now I feel I have a grasp on the technology. This project also helped elevate my front-end skills, by creating all the CSS myself and engaging with hovers and opacity to create a very responsive design for the website. I will happily send this to employers as a showcase of my prowess.
